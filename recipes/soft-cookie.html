    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 - Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl,
            cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.
            Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.
            Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours. </li>

        <li>Step 2 - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface,
            roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters. </li>

        <li>Step 3 - Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown.
            Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks. </li>
    </ol>
